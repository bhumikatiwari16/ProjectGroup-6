### 1. Title: Digital Citizenship
__Problem__: Everyday millions of people get trolled/abused online. Online bulling is depressingly common and everyday several stories about trolling are frequently in news. Is this the kind of digital footprint we would want to leave for the present and upcoming generations? Is there any solution to dealing with trolls and abuse? Can technology help us with this?

__Our proposed solution:__
An API running on intensive machine learning algorithms, which can tackle online trolls and abuse and help us be more digitally responsible. The API would use machine learning models to see the impact of a comment or content whether it would be perceived as abusive or toxic. The API could be used in several places: it could function as an online moderator; it could allow readers to find relevant information by filtering out irrelevant content from the discussion. It could also act as a parental control API, that could allow parents to restrict the view to abusive content on the internet. Also, it can assist commenters in real time, warning them if their comments might be perceived as toxic or abusive.

__Goal:__ With this project our goal is to help leave a clean digital footprint, be more responsible online and help reduce bullying or the side effects of reading abusive content.

__Technology Stack:__ Tensorflow/Keras, NLP, IBM Watson Speech to text, IBM Watson tone analyser (we want to see if the tone has any correlation to abusive comments), ReactJS, Python and other technologies TBD.
